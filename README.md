This notebook cleans the Project Gutenberg version of The Federalist Papers, then visualizes authorship counts, top term counts, and top named entity counts. Term counts are created after "lemmatizing" the texts. Lemmatization is a process that reduces words to their essential forms, or "lemmas." Lemmatizing the text, then counting the lemmas instead of the original terms, reduces the number of variants of a base term that show up in the counts.
